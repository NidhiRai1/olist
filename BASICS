Example: Making a choropleth map to show population density across states.

8.plotly.graph_objs: Provides fine-grained control for customizing Plotly charts.  
Example: Adding custom annotations to an interactive line chart.

9.json: Handles JSON data structures, often used in API responses.  
Example: Parsing weather data fetched from an online API.

10.requests: Facilitates sending HTTP requests to APIs or websites.
